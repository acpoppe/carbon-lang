## Abstract

This proposal evaluates some possible reasoning which may contribute to a
decision about naming the application entry point.

## Problem

While it isn't a pressing need, a standardization on the name of the entry point
will be necessary as execution starts from a consistent and known place.

## Background

Within Carbon community based discussions, the two names that have merrited
discussion so far have been `Main` and `Run`.

Overwhelmingly, the majority of mainstream programming languages use a version
of `Main` as their entry point (although capitalization varies based on the
language's standards). Some of the most prominent examples are C, C++, D, Zig,
Rust, Kotlin, Java, C#, Go, and Haskell.

Meanwhile, `Run` seems to be far less common as an application entry point,
although it does see more use as a framework entry point, likely aided by its
place in the English language as a "command" word. Notably it is also used by
Docker to begin running a container process.

## Proposal

Carbon officially adopts the name `Main` for its application entry point.

## Rationale

By going with `Main` the entry point both
[adheres to the principle of least surprise](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/blob/trunk/docs/project/goals.md#code-that-is-easy-to-read-understand-and-write)
and provides
[familiarity for experienced C++ developers with a gentle learning curve](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/blob/trunk/docs/project/goals.md#interoperability-with-and-migration-from-existing-c-code).

## Alternatives considered

Options for alternatives are limitless although few others are as standardized
or likely to receive support due to familiarity and convention.

Additionally, options representing a more dramatic paradigm shift such as (a)
user defined entry point(s) or similar structural changes have not been
discussed as they are outside of the scope of this proposal.
